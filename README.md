## About
This project was made for The Odin Project's [Blog API Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-blog-api) and works in conjunction with the [Blog API](https://github.com/brajpatel/blog-api). The API is used to fetch posts, post details and comments which are then displayed for the user. The main objectives of this project were:
- to separate the front and back-end
- to set up an API that could be accessed from outside (I.e. from the Blog Client)
## Check out the API
